<h1>What we do</h1>
<h3>WALLET</h3>
<p class="sub">
	At TantaPay, you control your money. There is no minimum balance required in
your wallet, no inactivity fees, and no sales gimmicks to upgrade your service or
increase your fees. Choose the currencies you want to hold in your wallet, and hold
them for as long as you want.
</p>
<h3>TRANSFERS</h3>
<p class="sub">
TantaPay believes payments should be fast, easy, and secure, no matter where you
are. Send money to your family overseas instantly, and without big transaction fees.
Pay your friends, your taxi driver, or your favorite restaurant instantly, securely,
and without the need for a bulky wallet.</p>

<h3>FOREIGN EXCHANGE</h3>
<p class="sub">Change currencies when you’re traveling without the hassle or fees of a Foreign
Exchange bureau. Exchange as much or as little money as you want, when you want,
at current market rates, without exchange fees. When you’re home, change back to
your local currency with the same ease and convenience, or keep the foreign
currency until your next trip.</p>

<h3>LEND</h3>
<p class="sub">No matter how much money you have today, we believe that everyone should have
an opportunity to build wealth. At TantaPay you can start building your wealth
today by lending to other TantaPay users based on your time horizon and risk
tolerance, putting your financial future in your own hands.
</p>
<h3>BORROW</h3>
<p>At TantaPay you can build a fair credit score based on your activity, not someone
else’s metrics, allowing you to borrow money based on your credit worthiness, not
the value of assets you can use as collateral. We allow the market to set the loan
terms, so you can know you are getting the best possible rate. As you build credit,
you can borrow larger amounts of money on better terms, creating a virtuous cycle
of growth for your business.</p>
